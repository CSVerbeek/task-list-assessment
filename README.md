# TaskListAssessment

This project is an assessment for the job of Front-end Developer. This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.5.

Create an angular application for a simple task list. The application must contain at least three components:

1. display task list
1. display task details
1. search field for finding tasks

Use a service to keep track of the data. Use routing between the components.

Expectations:

1. create a form for adding tasks to the list
1. use a fake API for retrieving tasks
1. search for tasks where the matches will be highlighted
1. unit testing
1. EXTRA - add authorisation

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
